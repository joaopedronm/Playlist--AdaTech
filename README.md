## Playlist - Ada Tech üë®‚Äçüíª

This is a small project where I create a Rock Playlist based on my journey through the Frot-End course at Ada (Let's Code).

The Playlist is composed of 6 songs, one for each module of the course; the title of the songs references the name of the module and the teachers are listed as the artists of the songs.
Enjoy It!
